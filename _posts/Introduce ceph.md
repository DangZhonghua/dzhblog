# Berif Introduction of CEPH
-------------------------------------
Ceph is open source software storage system which provide at least PB scale capability. Ceph is desigend for next-future storage system which provide uniform stroage capability: File System Service, Block Device Service, Object Storage Service.
ceph [source code](https://github.com/ceph/ceph) which is developed based on C++.

## Distribute Storage
The basic goal/requirment of distribute storage:

1. High Performance : Provide excellent concurrent IO request, high thoughput.
2. High Availability: In the case of some component failure, storage service still can provide service.
3. High Reliability:  Data in the distribute storage system will be store more than once to prevent data loss.
4. High Scalability:  Data Storage can extend its capability on demand.
5. Load Balance (computing/Storage balance): Data uniform distribution among all storage node.
